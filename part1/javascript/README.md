# Exercises 1.3-1.5

## 1.3: course information step3

* Let's move forward to using objects in our application. Modify the variable definitions of the App component as follows and also refactor the application so that it still works:

```javascript
const App = () => {
  const course = 'Half Stack application development'
  const part1 = {
    name: 'Fundamentals of React',
    exercises: 10
  }
  const part2 = {
    name: 'Using props to pass data',
    exercises: 7
  }
  const part3 = {
    name: 'State of a component',
    exercises: 14
  }

  return (
    <div>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```

## 1.4: course information step4

* And then place the objects into an array. Modify the variable definitions of App into the following form and modify the other parts of the application accordingly:

```javascript
const App = () => {
  const course = 'Half Stack application development'
  const parts = [
    {
      name: 'Fundamentals of React',
      exercises: 10
    },
    {
      name: 'Using props to pass data',
      exercises: 7
    },
    {
      name: 'State of a component',
      exercises: 14
    }
  ]

  return (
    <div>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```

* **NB** at this point you can assume that there are always three items, so there is no need to go through the arrays using loops. We will come back to the topic of rendering components based on items in arrays with a more thorough exploration in the [next part of the course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2).

* However, do not pass different objects as separate props from the App component to the components Content and Total. Instead, pass them directly as an array:

```javascript
const App = () => {
  // const definitions

  return (
    <div>
      <Header course={course} />
      <Content parts={parts} />
      <Total parts={parts} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## 1.5: course information step5

* Let's take the changes one step further. Change the course and its parts into a single JavaScript object. Fix everything that breaks.

```javascript
const App = () => {
  const course = {
    name: 'Half Stack application development',
    parts: [
      {
        name: 'Fundamentals of React',
        exercises: 10
      },
      {
        name: 'Using props to pass data',
        exercises: 7
      },
      {
        name: 'State of a component',
        exercises: 14
      }
    ]
  }

  return (
    <div>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```
